\item See \texttt{dla.py}. Running \texttt{python dla.py --help} will display input argument
information.
\item In order to speed up the process, we introduced various methods that adderessed both
efficiency and modified the traditional DLA description. In regards to (computational) efficiency, essentially 
the entire implementation is vectorized, allowing us to track diffusion across the entire space in parallel. 
In addition, the many of the item-wise comparison portions of the algorithm are implemented using Python generators such as \texttt{map}, \texttt{filter}, and \texttt{reduce}. 
These keywords allow us to stack complex computational routines that process the input matrix without iterating through the matrix more than once. Finally, we elected to use \texttt{skimage} to identify collision clusters in the matrix; we consider this to be an efficiency gain because their implementation is undoubted faster and potentially precompiled. We chose to modify the traditional DLA model by using 2-connectivity, meaning two particles
