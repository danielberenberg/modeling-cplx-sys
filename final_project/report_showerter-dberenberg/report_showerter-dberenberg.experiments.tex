%%%%%%%%%%%% Experiments \& Methods

We create 100 different populations, each of size $N = 10,000$, where each opinion vector of $d=7$ for each person is drawn at random from U$(-1,1)$.
We iterate through each population and run through the each algorithm presented in Section \ref{voting_systems}.
For this initial trial, we had $k=5$ nominees randomly selected from each population to run.
The masking of opinions for a single candidate in a sample population is determined and then kept constant as each voting system is run.
Thus for a transparency level of $t$, for a population $P$, the voting systems are the only variable changing.

\begin{enum_tight}
\item $k$ candidates are chosen at random from the population
\item Voting system 1: {\it General Election} is run:
\begin{enum_tight}
\item dissimilarity score is calculated for each person and each candidate based on unmasked dimensions, starting with mask $=0$.
\item each person votes for 1 candidate with lowest dissimilarity score.
\item candidate with most votes wins
\item dissimilarity score is calculated between every person and winner
\item average dissimilarity score and distribution of scores are recorded
\item mask $+= 1$
\item go back to 1. and repeat until mask $= d-1$.
\end{enum_tight}
\item Voting system 2: {\it Ranked-Choice Voting} is run:
\begin{enum_tight}
\item dissimilarity score is calculated for each person and each candidate based on unmasked dimensions, starting with mask $=0$
\item each person assigns a rank to every candidate with lowest dissimilarity score getting rank 1, next lowest getting rank 2, etc.
\begin{enum_tight}
\item if any candidate has $> 50\%$ of rank 1 votes, they win
\item otherwise, candidate with lowest number of rank 1 votes is dropped and every person's vote who ranked them as 1 is given to their rank 2 candidate
\item continue dropping lowest candidate and redistributing their votes until one candidate has $> 50\%$ of votes and they win
\end{enum_tight}
\item dissimilarity score is calculated between every person and winner
\item average dissimilarity score and distribution of scores are recorded
\item mask $+= 1$
\item go back to 1. and repeat until mask $= d-1$.
\end{enum_tight}
\item Voting system 3: {\it Approval voting} is run:
\begin{enum_tight}
\item dissimilarity score is calculated for each person and each candidate based on unmasked dimensions, starting with mask $=0$
\item each person gives a vote to every candidate with dissimilarity score under threshold $a$.
\item candidate with most votes wins
\item dissimilarity score is calculated between every person and winner
\item average dissimilarity score and distribution of scores are recorded
\item mask $+= 1$
\item go back to 1. and repeat until mask $= d-1$.
\end{enum_tight}
